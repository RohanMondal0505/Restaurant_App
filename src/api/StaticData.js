            'Chicken wings – Choose an organic, cornfed variety to get the juiciest and most succulent results. You could also use chicken drumsticks or thighs here, but you will need to adjust how long you’ll be cooking them for as they will take longer to cook through.\n\nItalian seasoning – You can make your own or buy a ready mix.  Most of these seasoning packs contain dried garlic, oregano, thyme, salt, and sometimes basil. You could just use any one or combination of the separate ones if you like.\n\nHoney – Use a runny, good quality one for some serious stickiness!',
